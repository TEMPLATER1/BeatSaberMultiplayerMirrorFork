*Hello, everyone! Beat Saber Multiplayer Mirror is probably my favorite mod in the game. I play multiplayer very often, and this mod is a real find for me! One evening, I wanted to speed up the update of my favorite mod, so I decided to take the initiative in development and make this fork to share with you the new version of the Multiplayer Mirror mod for the latest version of Beat Saber 1.42.x. Enjoy!*

# Many thanks to the mod creator Roy de Jong!

## Requirements

The mod may also work on earlier versions of the libraries, but I have never tested it. I compiled it and adapted it for the latest libraries.

Beat Saber: v1.42.0 or newer
BSIPA: v4.3.7 or newer
SiraUtil: v3.3.1 or newer
BeatSaberMarkupLanguage: v1.14.1 or newer

### ✅ Works with Beat Saber 1.42.0+
